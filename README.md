## Advanced Mode:

To use the advanced mode, visit the "Advanced" section of your customizer, and make sure that the "Toggle the advanced Bootstrap Builder" checkbox **is** checked.
When using this mode, **bootstrap's variables.less file is updated to include the user's options and the stylesheet file will be re-compiled with these options.
This way users can alter most bootstrap defaults.

Since by using the advanced mode **the changes are permanent and written to the filesystem**, it is not possible to use this mode on multisite installations. **Only super-admins can use the advanced mode in multi-site.**

The [default bootstrap customizer](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html) has an excessive amount of options available and can be a bit scary and confusing.
So we tried to minimize the options available by calculating many options based on the ones you make:

* **@black, @grayDarker, @grayDark, @gray, @grayLight, @grayLighter:** Calculated based on the background color and the text-color.
* **@borderRadiusLarge, @borderRadiusSmall:** Calculated based on the Base Border Radius.
* **@linkColorHover:** Calculated based on the link color.
* **@tableBackgroundAccent, @tableBackgroundHover, @tableBorder:** Calculated based on the background color.
* **@horizontalComponentOffset, @gridColumnWidth, @gridColumnWidth1200, @gridColumnWidth768, :** Based on layout options

The following options are **not available** when using the advanced mode:

#### Navbar

* Navbar Color

In addition to the default customizer options, the following options are available:

#### Layout

* Grid Width - Normal
